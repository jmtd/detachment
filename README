detachment

Removes attachments from RFC822-format mail files, replacing them with a
description of where to find them.

Very early stages, lots of missing pieces.

Usage:

   customize file (as below)
	./detachment <some-file>

Modifies files in-place.

Customisations:

detachment saves copies of attachments to a local folder. That local
folder is defined by the variable 'bucket' towards the top of the
file.

The assumption is that you will make that available at a URL somewhere.  That
URL is defined near the top of the file as a function parameterized over the
SHA1 sum (expressed in hex) of the file.
